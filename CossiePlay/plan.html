<h1>CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name: Prasish Maharjan</strong><br>
<strong>Login: JC519733</strong></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The mission of this project is to  generate more customers cosplaying CossiePlay's costumes and persuade them to buy them and increasing the participation rate in a monthly cosplay party through the interactive website. The main aim here is to help CossiePlay's increase their revenue through the user-friendly website by promoting the services offered by the company. Our website will help CossiePlay sell more costumes per week.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> We will measure the following six metrics to weigh whether our website has been successful OR the company CossiePlay's sales has been increasing.
<ol>
	<li>Number of visitors and their sources: One of the key metrics will be to check the number of old (regular) and new visitors our site sees each month.</li>
    <li>Bounce Rate: Have our customers bounced off suddenly withour buying or clicking any more pages/spending time on our website? We will measure this.</li>
    <li>Average Time On Page: We will check how much time costumers spend on our website.</li>
    <li>Conversion Rate: Have our customer actually converted themselves as potential customers or have they actually bought something from our website? We will count on this factor as an imperative part of success evaluation metric.</li>
    <li>Revenue: After successfully checking the performance of the website one of the other success evaluation metrics would be to check the sales/revenue increment of the CossiePlay, whether or not customers are, not just checking the website but are they actually participating, and therefore, increasing the number of enrollment in monthly party events and buying more costumes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Our current target customers are aged between 35 to 50 but we are trying to persuade younger generation including current aged group that we are targeting. So, therefore, we will target customers between aged group of 15 to 50.</p>
